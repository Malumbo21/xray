  <i>A blazing fast Docker (or any OCI-compliant) image layer inspector!</i>
</p>

> Xray helps developers understand and optimize container images by visualizing layers and their contents using a minimalistic but powerful UI with performance in mind.

## Features

![Demo](./resources/demo.gif)

- üõ†Ô∏è Supports **Vim motions**
- üìå Relatively **small memory footprint** (~80Mb for an 8Gb image)
- üóíÔ∏è Supports **path filtering** (with full *RegEx* support)
- ‚õìÔ∏è Supports **size-based filtering**
- üöÄ Fast startup times due to optimized image parsing
- üè° Convenient and minimalistic UI
- üì¶ Works with **any OCI-compliant container image**
- ‚öôÔ∏è No needless re-rendering of the UI: `xray` values your CPU cycles

## Disclaimer

This is essentially a beta release at this point, so don't hesitate to open an issue if you find any bugs while using it üçÄ

## Installation

### From source

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires the nightly compiler

```bash
# If Rust nightly wasn't installed before
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
$ cargo +nightly install --locked xray-tui
```

## Motivation

Everyone who had to work with container images before knows about the [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) tool. It's a great tool, but it doesn't work that well for bigger images, especially the ones that are 5 GB or more in size.

Xray fixes this problem by carefully managing available resources and applying a set of small but important optimizations. All these things make Xray far more responsive when used with large images, while still providing the core functionality and being easy to use.

## Usage

```bash
$ xray --help
Usage: xray [OPTIONS] <IMAGE>

Arguments:
  <IMAGE>


Options:
  -p, --config-path <CONFIG_PATH>
          Override the config directory location.

          Default: $HOME/.xray

  -d, --docker
          Force image resolution using Docker

  -f, --fs
          Force image resolution using a tarred image

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

### Using the app

To inspect an image use:

```bash
xray <IMAGE>[:tag]
```

`xray` will try to resolve the provided image using the default resolution order:

1. Look for a [tarred repository](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/save/) with image locally (treating the provided argument as a **path**)
2. Try to resolve the image using Docker

> üí° Please refer to `xray --help` if you want to force a specific image resolver.

### Keybindings

> üí° You can always use the *help popup* available by pressing `/` to get the *contextualized help* for the currently active pane.

#### Navigation

| `Left`, `h`  | scroll the current entry left (**if supported by pane**)  |
| `Down`, `j`  | select the next entry in the current pane                 |

| `Tab`        | cycle through the panes: next pane                        |
| `Shift-Tab`  | cycle through the panes: previous pane                    |
| `q`          | exit the app                                              |

#### Actions

| `/`              | open/close the help popup                                                     |

## Limitations

- Opaque whiteouts are not handled properly
- Some panes are missing the vertical/horizontal scroll feature, which may cause issues in certain contexts

## Planned Improvements

> This section contains additional good-to-have things that I plan to add besides fixing everything in the [Limitations](#limitations) section.

- Reduce the memory footprint further
- Add unit and fuzz tests
- Improve the scrolling behaviour in the "Layer Changes" tab
- Add more installation options
- Add configurable keybindings
- Add layer caching
